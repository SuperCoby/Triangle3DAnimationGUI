## Credits

- This project is based on the original repository by [Mokuura](https://github.com/Mokuura/Triangle3DAnimation).  
  I have adapted it into a executable (`.exe`) with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.

- Thanks to [TractorFan](https://github.com/SuperKulPerson) who helped me with optimization and bug fixes.
